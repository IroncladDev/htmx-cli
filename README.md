# HTMX CLI

The easiest way to get started with HTMX is to create a new project using the HTMX CLI.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g htmx-cli
yarn add -g htmx-cli
pnpm install -g htmx-cli
bun install -g htmx-cli
```

**Note**: You may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI globally.

After installing the CLI, use `htmx-cli init` to kickstart your new project.

You will be asked some questions such as the name of your project, whether you want to use Tailwind CSS, etc.
